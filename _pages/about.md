I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the [MIT GOV/LAB](https://mitgovlab.org/), where I run the reading group for AI and Political Science for the [Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC)](https://computing.mit.edu/). 

Previously, I worked as a CIFRE PhD student at the [Data Science and Mining Team](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/) of the Computer Science Laboratory at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), under the supervision of Professor [Michalis Vazirgiannis](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~mvazirg/), and as a research engineer for [LINAGORA](https://linagora.com/), under the supervision of Dr. [Julie Hunter](https://www.juliejhunter.com/). I graduated in August 2025 from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), specializing in data science. I also finished a Bachelor in Mathematics from [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/).

My research interest is in three main threads, mainly related to Natural Language Processing. Namely, **Dialogue Understanding and summarization**, studying the effect of **Large Language Models for Political bias and uses**, as well as **the application and democratization of AI for the deliberative health of democracy**
