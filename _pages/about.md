I am a CIFRE PhD student at the [Data Science and Mining Team](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/) of the Computer Science Laboratory at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), under the supervision of Professor [Michalis Vazirgiannis](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~mvazirg/). As a CIFRE PhD student, I also currently work as a research engineer for [LINAGORA](https://linagora.com/), under the supervision of Dr. [Julie Hunter](https://www.juliejhunter.com/). Prior to this PhD, I graduated from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), specializing in data science. I also finished a Bachelor in Mathematics from [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/).

My research interest is in two main subjects, both related to Natural Language Processing. Namely, **Dialogue Understanding and summarization**, as well as studying the effect of **Large Language Models for Political bias and uses**. I am currently underwriting my thesis and working on the development of **Large Language Models for dialogue generation** at Linagora, along with evaluating the role of Biases in LLMs on downstream tasks.
